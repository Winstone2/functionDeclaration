# functionDeclaration
Key characteristics of function declarations:

    Hoisting: Function declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing scope, which means you can call them before they are defined in the code.

    Named Function: Function declarations have a name (e.g., greet in the example above). This name is mandatory and can be used for recursion or referencing the function within itself.
